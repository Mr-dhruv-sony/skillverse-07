# 🌐 SkillVerse

> **Learn without paying. Grow by sharing.**

SkillVerse is a **peer-to-peer skill exchange platform** designed for students who want to learn new skills **without spending money**. Instead of paying for courses, students collaborate, teach each other, and earn credits that unlock learning resources.

---

## ✨ What is SkillVerse?

Traditional learning platforms often place knowledge behind paywalls. SkillVerse removes this barrier by creating a **knowledge-sharing ecosystem** where students learn through **collaboration and contribution**.

### Example:

* A student knows **Python** and wants to learn **Java**
* Another student knows **Java** and wants to learn **Python**
* SkillVerse matches them → both learn for free

If no direct match is found:

* The student teaches their skill to others
* Earns **Skill Credits**
* Uses credits to access **recorded lessons, notes, and curated content**

No money. Just skills.
